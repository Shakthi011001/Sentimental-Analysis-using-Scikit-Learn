# Sentimental-Analysis-using-Scikit-Learn
Here we will build a classifier that is able to distinguish movie reviews as being either 
positive or negative. For that, we will use Dataset of IMDB movie reviews. This dataset 
contains 50,000 movie reviews divided evenly into 25k train and 25k test. The labels are 
balanced between the two classes (positive and negative). 
Neutral reviews are not included in the labeled data. All reviews for a given movie are either in train or test set but not in both, in 
order to avoid test accuracy gain by memorizing movie-specific terms.
