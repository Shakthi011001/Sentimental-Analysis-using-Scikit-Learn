Sentiment analysis refers to analyzing an opinion or feelings about something using data 
like text or images, regarding almost anything. Sentiment analysis helps companies in 
their decision-making process. For instance, if public sentiment towards a product is not 
so good, a company may try to modify the product or stop the production.
Although there are several known tasks related to sentiment analysis, in this project we 
will focus on the common binary problem of identifying the positive / negative sentiment 
that is expressed by a given text toward a specific topic. In other words, the texts that we 
deal with in this project, must express either positive or negative sentiment, and they 
cannot be neutral about the topic. There are other tasks that allow a text to be neutral 
about a specific topic, or even totally objective, i.e. expressing no interest in the topic at 
all. By narrowing down the problem like this, we get a classic binary classification case.
